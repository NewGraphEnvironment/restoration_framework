## Prerequisites

- **R** (>= 4.1)
- **Zotero** with [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) running locally (for bibliography generation via `rbbt`)
- **PostgreSQL** connection to `bcfishpass` database on `localhost:63333` (for river, lake, dam, and town spatial data)
- **BC Data Catalogue** access (for BEC zone polygons via `bcdata`)

### R packages

```r
pak::pak(c("sf", "mapgl", "DBI", "RPostgres", "dplyr", "bcdata", "base64enc",
           "bookdown", "rbbt"))
```

## Render

```r
rmarkdown::render("cottonwood-seed-transfer.Rmd")
```

The output is a self-contained HTML file (~59 MB) with an interactive MapLibre GL map. The large file size is due to embedded BEC zone geometries and base map resources.
